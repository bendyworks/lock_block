# LockBlock

Mark sections of Ruby code as important. Check if these sections
have changed.  The difference checking intelligently ignores code
formatting.

## Usage

Installing this gem provides command line programs to annotate Ruby
code.

`cat snippet.rb | lock_block`

## For later

More detailed instructions coming soon.
